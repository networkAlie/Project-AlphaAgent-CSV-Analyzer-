# Project AlphaAgent: CSV Analyzer

This application is the second stage of the **Project AlphaAgent** workflow, an AI-Powered Web3 Discovery system designed for Alie Network's HUBS initiative. This tool focuses on the analysis, verification, and prioritization of data generated by the initial discovery agent.

## Overview

While the initial AlphaAgent discovers potential Web3 projects, this **CSV Analyzer** transforms that raw data into actionable intelligence. It provides a comprehensive dashboard to filter, visualize, prioritize, and, most importantly, verify the legitimacy of projects found during the "Scanning Day" phase. This ensures that the Alie Network team focuses its outreach efforts only on the most promising, validated opportunities.

## The Problem: From Raw Data to Actionable Leads

The discovery agent produces a valuable list of potential projects in a CSV file. However, this raw data presents its own challenges:

- **Information Overload:** A raw list can contain hundreds of projects, making it difficult to identify the true gems.
- **Time-Consuming Vetting:** Manually visiting each website and searching for project details to verify its legitimacy is a significant bottleneck.
- **Lack of Insight:** A simple spreadsheet doesn't reveal trends, category dominance, or the overall quality of the discovered leads.
- **Subjective Prioritization:** Deciding which projects to contact first can be inconsistent without a standardized scoring system.

## The Solution: Automated Analysis & AI-Powered Verification

The **Project AlphaAgent CSV Analyzer** solves these problems by providing a powerful, client-side interface to process the raw data. It automates the entire analysis and verification workflow.

The application ingests the CSV, applies a set of "Alpha Hunting" rules, visualizes the results, and uses the Gemini API's Search Grounding capabilities to provide one-click verification for any project, confirming its existence and providing a confidence score.

## Key Features

- **üìä Interactive Dashboard:** Automatically generates summary statistics and visual charts for project categories, launch statuses, and potential score distributions.
- **ü§ñ Automated Alpha Hunting Filters:** Applies predefined rules to instantly filter the raw data, focusing on projects with a potential score of 6+, relevant Web3 categories (GameFi, DeFi, AI, etc.), and a valid launch status.
- **üìà Priority Scoring Engine:** Calculates and assigns a `priorityScore` to each project based on a weighted algorithm, allowing the team to focus on the highest-impact opportunities first.
- **‚úÖ One-Click AI Verification:** Leverages the Google Gemini API to perform a real-time web search, verify a project's legitimacy, and return a summary, a confidence score, and direct evidence links.
- **üìÑ Smart CSV Parsing:** Robustly handles various CSV formats and column headers, including those with Turkish characters (e.g., `Potansiyel_Skoru`).
- **üîê Secure & Client-Side:** The user's Gemini API key is stored exclusively in the browser's local storage and is never transmitted to any server, ensuring complete privacy.
- **üì• Data Export:** The final, filtered, prioritized, and verified list can be easily exported to a new CSV file, ready for the outreach team.

## How to Use

1.  **Get API Key:** Obtain a Google Gemini API Key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2.  **Enter API Key:** When you first open the application, you will be prompted to enter your API key. It will be saved in your browser for future sessions.
3.  **Upload CSV:** Click "Upload a file" and select the CSV generated by the AlphaAgent discovery tool (e.g., `ham_veri.csv`).
4.  **Analyze Data:** The application will instantly process the file and display the analysis dashboard, including charts and the prioritized project list.
5.  **Verify Top Projects:** For promising projects in the list, click the **"Verify"** button. The AI will analyze the project in real-time and return a verification status and confidence score.
6.  **Review & Export:** After reviewing the analyzed and verified data, click the **"Export as CSV"** button to download the enriched list for your outreach campaign.
